## Build System:
>**ubuntu 16.04 LTS <br />
>OS type: 64 bit**

## Requirements:
>**python 2.7.12 in terminal**

## Command for Terminal in Linux:
Note: All the codes submitted are tested on Python 2.7.12 only
>**python q1_driver.py      (in folder q1, for Question 1)<br />
>python q2_driver.py      (in folder q2, for Question 2)<br />
>python q3_driver.py      (in folder q3, for Question 3)<br />
>python q4_driver.py      (in folder q4, for Question 4)<br />
>python q5_driver.py      (in folder q5, for Question 5)<br />
>python q6_driver.py      (in folder q6, for Question 6)<br />
>python q7_driver.py      (in folder q7, for Question 7)<br />
>python q8_driver.py      (in folder q8, for Question 8)<br />
>python q9_driver.py      (in folder q9, for Question 9)<br />
>python q10_driver.py      (in folder q10, for Question 10)**

## Class Diagrams:
>**The class diagrams of all the ten(10) questions are compiled in a single pdf file named *"classDiagrams.pdf"*. 
>The page number 'x' in the file classDiagrams.pdf corresponds to the class diagram of the question number 'x'**.

## Documentation:
>**Documentation of each question is done separately (filename "*Documentation.pdf*") and can be found in the respective folder of the question**.

## Tools used:
>***Sublime text* for code writing & editing. <br />
>*Terminal* for code testing.<br />
>Language used: *python 2.7.12*. <br />
>*epydoc* and *Latex* for Documentation. <br />
>Class diagrams of Question 1 & 2 are made manually using *StarUML*, and for all other questions *pyreverse* (a component of *pylint*) is used to automatically generate the class diagrams**.
