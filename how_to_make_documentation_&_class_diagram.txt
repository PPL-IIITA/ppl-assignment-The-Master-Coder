Documentation:

Documentation is created using "Epydoc" version 3.0.1, which is an automatic API documentation generation application for Python.

Documentation is in "html" format.

Documentation of each question is done separately.

To open Documentation of a Question:

1. Open the folder of that question, and in that folder go to the folder named "Documentation".
2. Open "index.html" in a browser.

Requirements to create Documentation:

1. Epydoc installed in terminal.

Command to install Epydoc in terminal:
	sudo apt-get install python-epydoc

Process to create Documentation of a question:
*** NOTE: Before generating Documentation for a question, remove all ".pyc", ".csv" and ".txt" files from the folder of that question, to avoid any warnings/errors. ***

1. Open terminal in the folder of a question.
2. Use command (in terminal):
	epydoc --html -o DOCUMENTATION --name <question-name> *


Class Diagrams:

Requirements:
1. pylint installed in terminal (needed to use pyreverse).

Command to install pylint:
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install pylint 

Process to create class diagram of a question:
*** NOTE: Before generating class diagram for a question, remove all ".pyc", ".csv" and ".txt" files from the folder of that question, to avoid any warnings/errors. ***

1. Open terminal in the folder of a question.
2. Use command (in terminal):
	pyreverse * -o jpg

Notes:
The above command will create two jpg files (class diagrams), one of classes and other of packages.

In my pdf file for all the class dagrams of all the questions (i.e the file named "classDiagrams.pdf"), I have merged 
the two jpg files of each question into a single jpg file, and then I merged all the jpg files of all questions 
into a single pdf file.
