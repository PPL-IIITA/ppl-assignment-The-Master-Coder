Documentation:

Documentation is created using "Epydoc" version 3.0.1, which is an automatic API documentation generation application for Python.

Documentation is in "pdf" format.

Documentation file of each question is named "Documentation" and can be found in the respective folder of the question.

Requirements to create Documentation:

1. Epydoc installed in terminal.

Process to create Documentation of a question:

1. Open terminal in the folder of a question.
2. Use command (in terminal):
	epydoc --pdf --name Documentation *


Class Diagrams:

Requirements:
1. pylint installed in terminal (needed to use pyreverse).

Process to create class diagram of a question:

1. Open terminal in the folder of a question.
2. Use command (in terminal):
	pyreverse * -o jpg

Notes:
The above command will create two jpg files (class diagrams), one of classes and other of packages.

In my pdf file for all the class dagrams of all the questions (i.e the file named "classDiagrams.pdf"), I have merged 
the two jpg files of each question into a single jpg file, and then I merged all the jpg files of all questions 
into a single pdf file.
