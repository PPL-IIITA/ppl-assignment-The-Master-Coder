All the required data files are generated (with random data) using the function named "utility" defined in the file named "utility.py" which can be found in every question folder.

All the data files are generated during the runtime of the program.

With each run of the program, data files with new data are generated.

Python codes are compiled and executed simultaneously using a single command (given in "how_to_execute.txt" file), so no need to first compile the program and then run it.
